# dAppGov — Decentralized Governance dApp

A lightweight, static front-end for a blockchain governance dApp. This repository currently contains a single-page app (`index.html`) that can be opened directly in a browser or served via a simple local web server.

> Assumption: The repo consists of a static `index.html` UI. If/when you add JS/CSS/assets, the instructions still apply.

## Contents

- `index.html` — Main application page.

## Quick Start

You have a few options to run this locally.

### Option 1 — Open directly in a browser

- Double-click `index.html` or drag-drop it into your browser.
- If the page needs a web server (e.g., to access wallet scripts or fetch JSON), use Option 2/3 below.

### Option 2 — VS Code Live Server (recommended)

1. Install the VS Code extension `ritwickdey.LiveServer`.
2. Open this folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server".

### Option 3 — Simple local server (PowerShell / Windows)

- Using Python (if installed):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

- Using Node.js (if installed):

```powershell
npx http-server -p 8080
# Or
npx serve . -l 8080
```

## Configuration

If the UI expects network RPC URLs, chain IDs, or contract addresses, add/update them where referenced in your HTML/JS. Common patterns include constants or placeholders like `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, `RPC_URL`, or `CHAIN_ID` inside script tags.

## Deployment

Because this is a static site, you can deploy it easily:

- GitHub Pages: push the files to a GitHub repo and enable Pages on the `main` branch (root).
- Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages: drag-and-drop or connect the repo; no build step required.
- Any static web host (S3 + CloudFront, etc.).

## Development Tips

- Keep all assets (scripts, styles, images) relative so the site works both locally and when deployed.
- If you integrate web3/wallets, ensure you handle cases where no provider is available and display a helpful message.
- For multi-network support, surface the active chain and provide a way to switch.

## Roadmap (suggested)

- Add a minimal JS module for wallet connection and contract calls.
- Display proposals, allow voting, and show results (if applicable to your contracts).
- Extract styles/scripts into separate files for maintainability.
- Add environment-based config (e.g., `config.js`) for addresses/URLs.
